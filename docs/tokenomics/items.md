# Items

Items fall into different categories and enable various game mechanics as well as increase your Heros power in battles.

## Trash items

Trash items only have the single ingame purpose of being reforged into certain new item categories like rings, amulets and more.
On trash items only the item level is relevant because this is the single stat that matters in **Reforging**.

The correlated item for Reforging is Charcoal. One reforge attempt uses one **Charcoal**. It costs 50 Gold in the **General Store**.

## Dust

Dust comes in three different colors, each having their own pool of possible Researching results.
The more challenging an adventures is (higher level, higher difficulty), the more powerful the Dust can be that you get.

## Gear

- Gear items can be found after succesfully beating the enemy at the end of an adventure. 
- Fill your Heroes' equipment slots with items from your inventory to increase their combat stats and thus the chance of winning.
- Gear can be lost during adventures due to the fragility attribute on it telling the chance of losing it.
- Both above points also apply to foreign Heroes you rented for adventures. Their Hero but your items, loot and losses.

- And of course the **Trading Post**, being a centerpiece of the players economy, is a good source for all different kinds of items .
