# Elevate Your Heroes: A Guide to Training and Upgrading

Training is the cornerstone of a hero's journey towards mastery. In the realm of Fortuvia, your heroes need to hone their skills to face the adversaries that lie ahead.

## Halls of Training

Four majestic halls await your heroes. Each hall specializes in nurturing a unique aspect of a hero's prowess. Employ the gold coins you've amassed from your daring adventures to elevate these hallowed halls, ensuring your heroes are always a step ahead in the leveling saga.

## Ascending the Levels

Heroes can soar to the zenith of power, reaching a maximum level of 90. The trick to efficient training lies in the harmony between a hero's average attribute level and the standing of the facility you choose for training.

## Strategy Corner: Tips and Tricks

- **Early Dominance**: A focus on Strength (STR) in the nascent stages fortifies your hero's damage and armor, laying a solid foundation for the battles to come.
- **Training Wisdom**: Harness the 'Repeat' function to economize on gas fees while perpetuating the training in the same facility.
- **Attribute Evolution**: As your journey unfolds, blend in Agility (AGI) for elevated dodge, attack speed, and critical hit chances. Intelligence (INT) morphs into a precious asset when you delve into the realm of spells and abilities, accessible through the "Research" domain.
