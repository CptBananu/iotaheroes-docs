# Adventures and Battles

In **IOTA Heroes**, adventuring is a cornerstone of the gameplay. Once you have a hero, the excitement begins!

## Starting an Adventure

- Navigate to the Hero Page and select the Adventure tab.
- Equip your hero with armor and weapons to prepare for the journey.
- Initially, you might not have any items, so it's recommended to start with easy adventures.

## Risks and Rewards

- Be cautious, there's a risk of losing your gear during adventures.
- Check the Fragility value on item tooltips to gauge the odds of an item being lost.
- Upon completion, your hero will return, allowing you to view the combat encounter and inspect your loot if victorious.

## Renting Heroes

- Short on playtime? Rent your hero to other players for passive income.
- Even when rented out, heroes remain in your wallet and can be sold on the marketplace.

## Upcoming PvP Tournament

- A PvP Tournament will be announced when many players reach max levels, offering exciting challenges and prizes.

Embark on thrilling adventures, face fearsome foes, and unearth hidden treasures in the lands of Fortuvia!
