# Reforging

Sometimes you find valuable items like powerful gear and sometimes you will get less attractive rewards from a successful adventure. 
Be it low level gear that is not worth wearing anymore or literal "trash" items. 

When you reforge items there are a few things to know:
- Only item level matters for the item level of the result
- Result is only based on the reforge materials item level. So when reforging 5 low item level materials you won't get high item level result.
- Base chance of reforging to be successful is 50% when only using trash items.
- You can increase the chance of successful reforging by including non-trash items into the used materials. 
  The higher an items quality is (border color) the higher the increase in chance of success:

  <table>
	<tr>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Trash</td>
		<td>Grey</td>
    <td>50.00 %</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Normal</td>
		<td>Red</td>
    <td>75.00 %</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Rare</td>
		<td>Green</td>
    <td>83.33 %</td>
